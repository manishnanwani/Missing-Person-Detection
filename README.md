# Missing-Person-Detection

Building a product, which will take a photo of a person as an input, and given a set of CCTV footages, to check whether the person was identified in the footage, and return the frames and timestamp of that person, if present. The other use case is identification of a wanted person in the CCTV footage.

PS: For this project, worked in a group of 3, as part of the Academic Capstone Project
