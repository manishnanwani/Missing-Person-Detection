# Missing-Person-Detection

Building a product, which will take a photo of a person as an input, and given a set of CCTV footages, to check whether the person was identified in the footage, and return the frames and timestamp of that person, if present. The other use case is identification of a wanted person in the CCTV footage.

The main python script to run is flask_app.py, which has an explicit call to all the functions fron the Intelligent_Vision.py


PS: For this project, worked in a group of 3, as part of the Academic Capstone Project
